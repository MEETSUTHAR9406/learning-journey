# DailyLog is about my Learning throughout the day.<br><br>

#Day - 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Learned about Void Pointer and NULL pointer.<br>
(04/07/2025)<br><br>

==========================================================================================<br><br>

## Void Pointer: A generic pointer<br>
It is a Pointer that can hold any data type address, but we need to exclusively define it.<br><br>

### Example:<br><br>

<pre><code>int x = 10;
void *ptr = &x;

printf("%d", *(int *)ptr); // 10
printf("%d", *ptr); // Can't do like this.
</code></pre>

## NULL Pointer: It is like defining NULL to pointer then assigning values whenever need it.<br>
// If we don't declare NULL then it might print Garbage Value.<br><br>

### Example:<br><br>

<pre><code>int *ptr = NULL;
int choice = 1;

if(choice) {
  ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
  *ptr = 42;
}

if(ptr != NULL) 
  printf("%d", *ptr); // 42
else
  printf("This pointer is NULL.");
</code></pre>

<br>

#Day - 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Learned about Dangling Pointer & Wild Pointer.   <br>
(05/07/2025)<br><br>

==========================================================================================<br><br>

## Dangling Pointer: It is like freeing the Pointer and then trying to access it.<br>
If we try to access it we might get Garbage Value.<br><br>

### Example:<br><br>

<pre><code>int a = 10;
int *ptr = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr);
printf("%d", *ptr); // This is Dangling Pointer
ptr = NULL; // This becomes NULL Pointer now
</code></pre>

## Wild Pointer : It is like not assigning value to the pointer but then trying to dereference it.<br><br>

### Example:<br><br>

<pre><code>int a = 24;
int *ptr;

printf("%d", *ptr); // This is a Wild Pointer.
</code></pre>

<br>

#Day - 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Did Matrix Multiplication.<br>
(06/07/2025)<br><br>

==========================================================================================<br><br>

## Matrix Multiplication  <br>
- Tried doing Matrix Multiplication of 2D matrix and got succeeded.  <br>
- Used functions and user inputs to get the size of the Matrix.<br><br>

## Preprocessor Directives  <br>
Learned about:  <br>
<code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code>, <code>#undef</code>, <code>#ifdef</code>, <code>#ifndef</code>, <code>#if</code>, <code>#else</code>, <code>#elif</code>, <code>#endif</code><br><br>

<b>#include</b> <br>
- To include another file.  <br>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "myfile.h"
</code></pre>

<b>#define</b><br>
- To define a constant or macro.<br>
<pre><code>#define PI 3.14
</code></pre>

<b>#undef</b><br>
- To undefine a macro which was defined earlier.<br>
<pre><code>#undef PI
</code></pre>

<b>#ifdef</b><br>
- To check if macro is actually defined.<br>
<pre><code>#define DEBUG

#ifdef DEBUG
  printf("It is defined.");
#endif
</code></pre>

<b>#ifndef</b><br>
- To check if macro is not defined. If not defined you can define it.<br>
<pre><code>#ifndef PI
#define PI 3.14
#endif
</code></pre>

<b>#if, #else, #elif, #endif</b><br>
- Used for conditional compilation for macros.<br>
<pre><code>#define VALUE 5

#if VALUE == 5
  printf("The value is 5\n");
#elif VALUE == 10
  printf("The value is 10\n");
#else 
  printf("Value is something else.");
#endif // Closes all blocks like #if, #ifdef, #ifndef.
</code></pre>


#Day - 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Did Matrix Multiplication.<br>
(07/07/2025)<br><br>

==========================================================================================<br><br>


## Palindrome Numbers  <br>

Learned about:  <br>
<code>fopen()</code>, <code>fclose()</code>, <code>fgetc()</code>, <code>fgets()</code>

#Day - 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Did Matrix Multiplication.<br>
(08/07/2025)<br><br>

==========================================================================================<br><br>


## File Input/Output <br>
Learned in detail about:  <br>
<code>fopen()</code>, <code>fclose()</code>, <code>fgetc()</code>, <code>fgets()</code>, <code>fputc()</code>, <code>fputs()</code>
- Completed making a bill replacing string in Pre-written file.

<b>fopen()</b><br>
- To open any file either <b>Text file</b> or <b>Binary file</b>
- There are many mods by which we can open files, <b>r, w, r+, w+ rb</b>

<b>fclose</b><br>
- After opening a file and completing task you must close the while which was opened.
- fclose automatically closes the file which was opened earlier.


#Day - 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Learned about File Modes in detail & Command line Arguments.<br>
(09/07/2025)<br><br>

==========================================================================================<br><br>


<b>fgetc()</b><br>
- To get a single character from the file.

<b>fgets</b><br>
- fgets() is almost same as fgetc() the difference is that while fgetc() was used to get a single character, fgets() is used to get string of characters.

<b>fputc()</b><br>
- To enter a single character in a file. 
- If the file is in "w" write mode then first it cleans the file and then writes the content.

<b>fputs()</b><br>
- Same as fputc(), The main difference is that fputs() is used to pass the string of characters to file.
- Also same here, If the file is in "w" write mode then first it cleans the file and then writes the content.

## Command Line Arguments <br>

## ðŸ”¢ Command Line Arguments

I practiced how to use **command line arguments in C**.

### Code Overview

- Accepts an **operation type** (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)
- Accepts **two numbers**
- Performs the selected operation using `argv[]` and `atoi()`

### Example Command:
./calculator add 10 5
